# WebAppFirewall-Project
A web application firewall that will detect potential threats like XSS and SQL injection by inspecting HTTPS request payloads.

# Features:

- Detects common web threats using regex.

- Command-line interface for testing HTTP payloads.

- Blocks malicious requests.

# How to Run

Prerequisites:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher.

- An IDE or command-line environment.

# Compilation:

bash

Copy code
javac WebApplicationFirewall.java

# Execution:

bash

Copy code
java WebApplicationFirewall

# Code Explanation

- threatPatterns: List of regex patterns to identify threats.

- inspectPayload: Checks the payload against known threat patterns.

- Outputs whether the request is safe or blocked.

# Customization:

- Add more regex patterns for detecting different types of threats.

- Integrate with a web server for real-time request analysis.

# Limitations:

- Basic regex detection may not catch complex or obfuscated threats.

- No logging or alerting mechanisms implemented.

# Future Enhancements:

- Implement machine learning for dynamic threat detection.

- Integrate with real-time monitoring and logging tools.
